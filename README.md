## Geog778_Practicum: Yearly Ridership Data Visualization And Analysis For The Taipei Metro System In Taiwan
<p>
  This repository is used for uploading the products developed by me in the Geog778 practicum course.<br>
  My project contains 2 products: (1) Jupyter Notebook, (2) 2D web-based interactive map. These two products are used for different kinds of audiences, and they also serve different kinds of use case scenarios.<br>
  The Jupyter Notebook gives a working guideline to organize and visualize the data for technical users, such as GIS Analysts. The project topic is set to the dataset comes from Taiwan where GIS Analysts are not common, so I believe my way to do it can be a very good reference for them. The guideline can also be used by analysts in other countries or regions where GIS technology is just imported. <br>
  The 2D web-based interactive map is intended to serve as an alternative way for audiences that do not have a technical background, so they do not need to set up their environment just for exploring the content of the map. The only thing they need will be a web browser. In addition, this map is easier for users to navigate and also provides the context about the project and the background information about the topic which will be much more friendly for people who are not involved in this industry.

## Note
1. When use the Jupyter notebook, it would require to install the following modules: pandas, geopandas, Pydeck, and ipywidgets.
